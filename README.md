# AtomicAssets
AtomicAssets is a Non Fungible Token (NFT) standard for eosio blockchains developed by [pink.network](pink.network).

It focuses heavily on RAM efficiency and usability and is deployed under the name **atomicassets** on the WAX Testnet.

## Key Features

- **Presets**

	Assets have presets, which can store data themselves. This allows grouping similar assets together and means that you can save RAM by not having to store the same data for each asset individually.
	
- **Data Serialization**

	AtomicAssets uses a custom built serialization, which significantly reduces RAM costs compared to traditional methods (e.g. JSON strings). Serialization is done within the contract, which guarantees that no corrupt data enters the blockchain.
	
- **No RAM Costs for users**

	The RAM cost is paid fully by the dapps that create the assets. Even when transfering assets, this stays the same. The maximum an end user will ever have to pay are 112 bytes for their own scope, and even that will likely only rarely be necessary.
	This also means that AtomicAssets works completely **without claims**. Transfers are instant and no further user action is required.
	
- **Minimal fixed RAM costs**

	Creating an asset only costs **151 bytes** (112 of which are for the necessary index). Additionally, each token owner needs to have a scope, which costs **112 bytes**. 
	
- **Notifications for Smart Contracts**

	Smart Contracts can get notified automatically about any relevant events related to their assets. This enables them to make the assets an integral part of their game rather than just a static token.
	
- **Backing assets with Core Tokens**

	Assets can be backed by standard fungible tokens (e.g. EOS/ WAX). Those tokens can only be freed by burning the asset, thus allowing dapps to give their asset a guaranteed intrinsic value.
	
- **Powerful Trade Offers**

	AtomicAssets features a native implementation of two sided trade offers (similar to Steam or WAX Express Trade). This allows creating and accepting offers **with a single action**.
	The implementation of the offers also allows for **peer to peer marketplaces** that don't require transferring ownership to a market contract.
